About

This is my Hammerspoon configuration as I learn about it and tweak it, slowly replacing some of the tools/scripts that I use with Hammerspoon. I started with replacing [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com), for window management.

Dependencies

You'll need to install [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org). There's a wonderful [Getting Started guide](http://www.hammerspoon.org/go/).
